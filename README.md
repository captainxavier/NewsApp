**Project: Jetpack Compose News App**

This project showcases a real-time news app built with Jetpack Compose, offering an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to explore news from around the world.

**Features:**

Fetch news articles from various sources (implementation details to be added later)
Display fetched news articles in a clean and user-friendly format
Integrate navigation to explore different sections of the app (e.g., categories, saved articles)
Implement caching and offline functionality using Room and DataStore (consider adding details in the future)

**Technologies:**

* Jetpack Compose: Modern UI framework for declarative and performant user interfaces.
* Navigation: Streamlined navigation between different screens within the app.
* Dependency Injection (Dagger Hilt): Simplified dependency management for clean and modular code.
* Retrofit: Efficient network communication for fetching news data from APIs.
* Coil: Powerful image loading library for displaying news article images.
* DataStore: Persists user preferences and app state across app sessions.
* Compose Foundation: Core building blocks for creating Compose UI elements.
* Paging 3: Optimized data loading for large datasets, enabling efficient handling of paginated news results.
* Room: Local database for offline storage and efficient data retrieval (cache functionality to be explored).

**Modern Dependency Management with Version Catalogs:**

This project utilizes version catalogs, a modern approach to managing dependencies in large Android projects. This ensures consistent and centralized dependency versions across modules, simplifying maintenance and reducing conflicts.
